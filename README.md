# XBTools
 

XBTools is an all in one application for your Xbox 360 needs.
XBTools is a fork of J-Runner With Extras by Octal. 

The main differences are a completely new and refreshed UI, as well as some occasional features added in that aren't in J-Runner.
XBTools was build on C# WPF instead of C# WinForms like J-Runner.

My main goal is to offer a better user experience by cleaning up the UI and making stuff easier to use or easier accessible.
